What is the notebook trying to analyze?

The notebook tries to determine the best way to predict credit card fraud. It analyzes different given variables to see which ones are the best indicators of whether a purchase was fraudulent or not using k-NN. To do this, I used AI to help write code far faster than I could manually. 

I would definitely say that speed was the main benefit of utilizing AI. There were a few times that it would make errors that I had to go back and forth to fix, but overall it was relatively easy compared to trying to do it all myself. 

I think that if someone tries to use Ai to recreate this notebook without having any data science or computer science knowledge, they would run into some issues. There were a few times that ChatGPT would make an error that did not result in an error message, but did cause my results to differ from the results in the given notebook. The only reason that I was able to fix this is because I have learned about data science, so I knew what to look for and what to fix. One example of this was when I split the data into training and testing sets. The test_size variable initially given by the AI was set to 0.3 instead of 0.2, and while this would not affect much if I was just doing this myself, it did cause me to get different numbers than the example before I realize the issue.
